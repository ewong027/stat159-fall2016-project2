This is the output of the ten-fold cross validation using Lasso regression
 on the training data set
Partial least squares regression , fitted with the kernel algorithm.
Cross-validated using 10 random segments.
Call:
plsr(formula = Balance ~ ., data = train_set, validation = "CV")

This is the minimum lambda that represents the "best" model
[1] 7

This is the MSE of the testing data set when the training model is implemented
[1] 0.0519598

These are the official coefficients calcualted using the "best" model lambda and the full datset
