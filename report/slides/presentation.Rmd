# Purpose of the Project

## Overview of Project
- Purpose: to compare different types of regression models
    - Ordinary Least Squares
    - Ridge Regression
    - Lasso Regression
    - Principal Components Regression
    - Partial Least Squares Regression
- Based on Chapter 6 *Linear Model Selection and Regularization* of the book **An Introduction to Statistical Learning** by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani

## Data Used
- Using data that originated from Credit.csv
    - Qualitative Variables: gender, student status, martial status, and ethnicity
    - Quantitative Variables: one's age, the number of credit cards one has, years of education, income measured in thousands of dollars, credit limit, credit rating, and one's average credit card debt
- In analysis, using scaled-credit.csv
    - All of the variables are the same as those in Credit.csv
    - Modified with the **qualitative** by making them dummy variables
    - Then centered the mean and standardized the data so everything is in the same units --> allows for comparison
    
# Types of Regression

## Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

## Ridge Regression

## Lasso Regression

## Principal Components Regression (PCR)

## Partial Least Squares

# Why Look at Different Types of Regression?

##Use other models to improve model prediction accuracy
- Ordinary least squares is most effective when the number of observations (n) is much larger than the number of variables (p) in the model due to minimizing variance
- When n >> p is **not true** variance can be large which means there is a wider range of predictions --> accuracy is lowered

##Some variables are not correlated with response variable
- Ordinary least squares will use all predictors even if not all of them are correlated with the response --> can cause analysis to be more complicated
- Other models will set the coefficent of those uncorrelated variables to zero --> will allow for easier analysis
